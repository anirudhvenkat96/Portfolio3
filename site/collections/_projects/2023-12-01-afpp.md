Chemung County’s Agricultural & Farmland Protection Plan (AFPP) translates a wide set of agricultural conditions—land use, soil quality, farm viability, and conversion pressure—into a clear preservation narrative and an action-oriented prioritization framework.

Chapters 4 and 5 move from **baseline conditions** (what agriculture looks like today) to **protection logic** (where farmland is most valuable and most at-risk) and a **countywide prioritization approach** that can guide outreach, funding, and land-use decisions.

### Existing Agricultural Landscape

Chemung County’s agricultural footprint remains a defining land use, but it is increasingly shaped by edge conditions—subdivision pressure, infrastructure expansion, and farm succession. The AFPP frames agriculture not only as land in production, but as an economic base and a resilience asset that requires deliberate spatial protection.

### Soil and Land Capability

Productive soils are a non-negotiable foundation for long-term viability. The plan elevates soil classifications—particularly prime soils and soils of statewide importance—as core inputs to preservation prioritization, ensuring that limited conservation resources target land with enduring agricultural capacity.

---

### Development Pressure and Edge Risk

The AFPP emphasizes that farmland loss is rarely random; it is often induced by proximity to growth-enabling conditions such as infrastructure, roadway access, and zoning that allows small-lot residential patterns. The plan uses these indicators to identify where working landscapes are most likely to face conversion pressure.

### Existing Protections and the Agricultural District Program

Chemung County’s consolidated Agricultural District provides the backbone of existing protections, including tax relief mechanisms and policy safeguards. The AFPP positions these tools as a baseline—necessary but insufficient on their own—requiring a more targeted approach to prioritizing where protection efforts should concentrate.

### Countywide Prioritization Framework

A key AFPP contribution is the shift from “protect farmland broadly” to “protect farmland strategically.” The plan describes a composite prioritization logic that integrates:

- **Soil quality**
- **Parcel size and contiguity**
- **Active agricultural land use**
- **Development pressure and conversion risk**

The resulting prioritization map is intended as a practical decision-support tool for funding, easement targeting, landowner engagement, and municipal coordination.

### Agricultural Viability Trends

The plan pairs spatial prioritization with an economic read of agriculture, documenting overall farm counts, sales profiles, and cost pressures. This connects land protection to the reality that preservation outcomes depend on whether farms can stay operational and profitable over time.

---

### Production and Sales Composition

By documenting what drives farm revenue and how production is distributed, the AFPP clarifies where the county’s agricultural economy is most vulnerable—and where targeted support strategies (technical assistance, infrastructure direction, and program alignment) can strengthen long-term viability.

---

### Succession and the Next Generation

The AFPP flags producer age and succession as an urgent structural issue. Preserving land without enabling farm transfer pathways risks creating “protected” farmland that is underutilized or exits production over time. The plan positions succession support as an implementation priority that should be coordinated with land protection.

---

The AFPP’s central argument is that farmland protection is most effective when it combines **spatial targeting** (protect the best, most at-risk land) with **viability strategy** (keep farms in business, reduce edge conflicts, and support succession). The outcome is a framework that is implementable by counties, towns, and partners—rather than a purely descriptive inventory.
