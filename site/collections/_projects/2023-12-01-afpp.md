Chemung County’s Agricultural and Farmland Protection Plan (AFPP) documents the county’s working landscape and outlines a practical path to keep farming viable over the long term. The plan pairs a clear diagnosis of current conditions—farm trends, land resources, development pressure, and existing protection tools—with a focused set of strategies that local governments and partners can implement.

Rather than treating farmland as a static land-use category, the AFPP frames agriculture as an economic sector and a land system that depends on continuity: large, connected blocks of productive soils; predictable operating conditions; and policy tools that reduce conflicts and support reinvestment.

## What the AFPP does

- **Establishes baseline conditions** (farm operations and economic signals, land cover and soils, farmland conversion risks, protection status).
- **Identifies priority geographies** where protection and reinvestment can have the greatest impact.
- **Recommends implementable actions** (policy, funding, programs, and coordination) that fit Chemung County’s context.

## Existing Conditions and Trends

### Farm trends and operating conditions

The AFPP summarizes long-range agricultural trends to clarify what’s changing (e.g., farm counts, average size, sales, and program participation) and what those changes imply for viability. The narrative emphasizes that “farm retention” is as much about business conditions and generational transition as it is about land protection.

### Working landscape and land resource context

To ground recommendations in physical reality, the plan maps the county’s land base: where agriculture is currently concentrated, which areas have the strongest agricultural soils, and where fragmentation is most likely to undermine farm operations. These layers establish the logic for prioritization—protecting contiguous, productive areas and reducing edge conflicts.

## Farmland Protection Status and Gaps

### What’s protected today—and what isn’t

The plan inventories the county’s current protection landscape (e.g., agricultural districts, conservation easements, and active/previous protection projects). The key takeaway is that “protected” land is only one slice of the working landscape; long-term resilience depends on pairing protection tools with supportive local policy and reinvestment.

## Strategy Framework

### A focused implementation menu

The AFPP converts analysis into action through a structured set of recommendations—organized so municipalities and partners can adopt items incrementally. The emphasis is on tools that are realistic for local capacity: clear roles, defined next steps, and actions that align land-use policy with farm viability.

### From recommendations to near-term work program

The implementation narrative identifies who can do what, and in what sequence—linking policy updates, program development, and funding opportunities to a practical rollout approach. The goal is to make the AFPP usable as a work plan, not just a reference document.

## Outcome

Chemung County’s AFPP provides an evidence-based rationale for farmland protection while staying grounded in implementation. By connecting trend analysis, mapped prioritization, and an actionable recommendation set, the plan supports a long-term strategy: **protect key agricultural land blocks, strengthen farm viability, and reduce pressures that convert working landscapes into fragmented edges.**
