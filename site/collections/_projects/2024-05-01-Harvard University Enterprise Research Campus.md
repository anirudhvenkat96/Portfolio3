The concept plan envisions the Stadium Economic Impact Area as a complete neighborhood: one that celebrates the energy of the new Buffalo Bills Stadium while thriving as a destination in its own right. This should not be a single-use district, but a walkable, mixed-use community that combines housing, retail, recreation, and open space in a cohesive urban framework.

The plan should be organized around a connected network of streets, parks, and gathering spaces that form the backbone of the district. Near the stadium, the plan should encourage an active commercial and entertainment core, with restaurants, shops, and flexible spaces that support game-day crowds as well as daily life. Moving westward, these higher-intensity uses should transition seamlessly into neighborhood-scale housing, community greens, and small plazas that anchor the new development in everyday activity.

The layout should integrate the key design principles established throughout this plan:
Stadium-informed programming should activate the edge closest to the stadium with plazas, event spaces, and game-day amenities. Year-round vibrancy should be achieved through a mix of shops, homes, and civic uses that sustain economic activity beyond the football season.

Sensitivity to residential neighbors should be expressed through landscaped buffers, smaller-scale buildings, and new greenways that link existing neighborhoods to the stadium district.
Sustainability should underpin every element, from green infrastructure and rain gardens to compact development that encourages walking, biking, and transit use. Together, these components can create a lively, resilient, and inclusive environment: one that captures the excitement of the stadium while offering a lasting contribution to Hamburg’s identity. The result should be a neighborhood that feels distinctly Western New York: welcoming, community-oriented, and built to evolve over time.
