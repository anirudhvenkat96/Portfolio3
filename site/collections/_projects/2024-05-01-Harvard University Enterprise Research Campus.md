The Harvard University Enterprise Research Campus (ERC) represents a long-term transformation of underutilized land in Allston into a mixed-use district that integrates research, residential life, institutional expansion, and a robust public realm. This study evaluated interim and long-range development scenarios, testing program capacity, parcel sequencing, and edge conditions to ensure the campus evolves coherently over time.

Rather than treating parcels independently, the work focused on how phasing decisions influence skyline composition, neighborhood transitions, and public space continuity. Development sequencing was evaluated not only for square footage yield but for experiential and urban design performance.

### ERC Phasing Context

The phasing framework compared alternative build-out strategies, analyzing how parcels E5 through E12 could be sequenced to support market flexibility while maintaining urban design integrity. Each phase was evaluated against total GFA, land use distribution, parking strategy, and massing logic.

Particular attention was given to how interim conditions would perform spatially — ensuring that partial build-out conditions still produced legible streets, activated edges, and a continuous greenway connection.

### Planning Principles

The planning strategy was structured around three primary edges:

**Neighborhood Edge.** Building heights step down toward adjacent residential fabric, with podium massing and upper-level modulation used to mitigate scale impacts. View corridors and axial alignments were preserved to maintain permeability.

**Harvard Edge.** Along Western Avenue, a consistent streetwall establishes institutional presence while allowing select vertical elements to contribute to a calibrated skyline.

**Charles River Edge.** Development participates in the broader riverfront skyline while reinforcing greenway continuity. Parcel E12 serves as a vertical marker within the district composition.

Across all parcels, podium setbacks, terraces, and programmed ground floors support a 24-hour mixed-use environment. The objective was not only capacity optimization, but a cohesive urban framework.

### Street View

Street-level test fits ensured that density translated into a comfortable pedestrian realm. Active frontages, retail continuity, and scaled façade articulation were evaluated through perspective studies. The goal was to balance research-oriented program with neighborhood livability.

Ground floor transparency, material variation, and canopy placement were tested to support walkability and daily activity beyond peak academic or institutional hours.

### Public Realm Experience

The public realm framework completes and extends the Allston Greenway, creating a connective spine through the district. Open spaces were positioned to anchor phases independently while forming a continuous landscape system at full build-out.

Terraced podiums, planted setbacks, and mid-block connections reinforce permeability. The experience of the river, neighborhood, and campus is intentionally interwoven, allowing the ERC to function as both a university expansion and an urban district.

### Phasing & Test Fits

Detailed parcel test fits calibrated FAR, floor plate efficiency, and parking ratios across scenarios. Structured versus underground parking options were evaluated for cost, flexibility, and long-term adaptability.

Each option was analyzed for:
- Gross floor area distribution  
- Residential vs lab/office mix  
- Institutional expansion capacity  
- Skyline impact and massing hierarchy  

The resulting framework provides Harvard with a resilient development roadmap — one that accommodates changing program demands while preserving spatial coherence and civic quality.

This work illustrates how large-scale institutional expansion can operate as urbanism rather than enclave: phased, adaptable, and embedded within its surrounding context.
