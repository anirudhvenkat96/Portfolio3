      <p>In 2021, I graduated from Columbia University in the City of New York with a masters degree in Urban Design. 
      I was inspired and ready to make the world a better place by designing resilient and equitable urban environments for the communities I would serve. 
      For the next three years in Sasaki, I found the ideal training grounds to take my idealism and arm it with  
      the tools, work ethic and understanding of the industry that would help me find the best solutions for people and their living envirnments in a diverse range of places.

      <blockquote>
        <p>As an Urban Designer & Planner, I strive to uplift communities through design that puts people first. I am 
          dedicated to understanding and responding to the socioeconomic history of places that my work will impact.
        </p>

      <p>In 2025, I joined Fisher Associates in Rochester NY. Moving to a city that is much different from New York and Boston was an eye opening experience.
      I now have a better understanding of the ground realities of American urbanism. Working with smaller budgets in towns that desperately need economic and social revitalization helped
        me become a designer who is hyper aware of what it takes to get a project from the drawing board to the construction site and do it is a way that is respectful to the
        concerns and sensitivities of the local area.
