      <p>In 2021, I graduated from Columbia University in the City of New York with a Master’s degree in Urban Design. I left inspired to help build more resilient and equitable urban environments for the communities my work would serve.</p>

      <p>For the next three years at Sasaki, I found the ideal training ground to pair that idealism with the practical tools of the profession—rigorous design thinking, clear communication, and the discipline required to move complex projects from concept to implementation across a wide range of contexts.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>As an Urban Designer &amp; Planner, I strive to uplift communities through design that puts people first. I’m committed to understanding the social and economic histories of the places my work will impact—and translating that understanding into thoughtful, durable, and actionable plans.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>In 2025, I joined Fisher Associates in Rochester, NY. Working with towns and small cities—often with constrained budgets and urgent needs—sharpened my focus on feasibility and follow-through. It strengthened my understanding of what it takes to move from the drawing board to the construction site while staying responsive to local concerns, priorities, and sensitivities.</p>
