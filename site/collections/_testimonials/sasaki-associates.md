summary: At Sasaki, I worked on large-scale urban design and master planning projects, including Harvard’s Enterprise Research Campus and Beacon Park Yards, supporting long-range framework planning, development capacity analysis, and public-realm strategies. My work focused on site analysis, test fits, phasing, and graphic communication to translate complex planning and design concepts into clear narratives for clients and stakeholders.
